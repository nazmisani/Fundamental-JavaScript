## 📚 What You'll Find Here

This repo focuses on essential topics in JavaScript:

- 🧠 **Variables** – Understanding `var`, `let`, and `const` + scope.
- 🔧 **Functions** – From basic to arrow functions, including scope and closures.
- 🧮 **Arrays** – Creating, looping, and manual method implementations.
- 🧱 **Objects** – Working with properties, nested data, and structure.
- 🔄 **Programming Logic** – Conditionals, loops, and flow control.
- ⚡ **Code Efficiency** – Writing clean, optimized, and readable code.

## 🎯 Why This Repo?

> *“The stronger your foundation, the taller you can build.”*

I created this as a self-study playground to:
- 🛠 Practice solving problems using raw JavaScript
- 📌 Avoid relying on built-in methods too early (e.g., `.push()`, `.split()`)
- 💡 Build logic and problem-solving instincts from scratch
- 🧼 Learn to write code that's both **efficient** and **easy to read**
