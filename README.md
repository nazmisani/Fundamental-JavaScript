## 🎯 Why This Repo?

> _"The stronger your foundation, the taller you can build."_

I created this as a self-study playground to:

- 🛠 Practice solving problems using raw JavaScript
- 📌 Avoid relying on built-in methods too early (e.g., `.push()`, `.split()`)
- 💡 Build logic and problem-solving instincts from scratch
- 🧼 Learn to write code that's both **efficient** and **easy to read**

## 🖥️ Backend Training

This repository now includes a backend training section where I'm:

- 🌐 Building RESTful APIs with **Express.js**
- 📊 Learning database integration with **PostgreSQL**
- 🔄 Implementing server-side JavaScript
- 🧪 Practicing backend architecture patterns
- 🛠️ Setting up a complete Node.js development environment

The `backend_training` directory contains an Express application that serves as my playground for learning backend development concepts.
